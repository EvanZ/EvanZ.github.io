<p><strong>Research highlights:</strong>
<em>Designed and built an affordable experimental system for biomechanical testing of biological tissues at very small length scales. Similar in principle to the design of an atomic force microscope (AFM), the device is based on measuring deflection of a piezoelectric-driven glass microfiber cantilever beam assembly, and is still in use today.</em></p>
